Finding your perfect fragrance is a deeply personal journey. Your signature scent becomes part of your identity, leaving a lasting impression wherever you go.

## Understanding Fragrance Notes

Perfumes are composed of three layers:
- **Top Notes**: The initial scent you smell (citrus, herbs)
- **Heart Notes**: The core of the fragrance (florals, spices)
- **Base Notes**: The lasting impression (woods, musks, vanilla)

## Tips for Choosing

1. **Test on Your Skin**: Fragrances interact with your body chemistry
2. **Give It Time**: Wait 30 minutes to experience the full development
3. **Consider the Occasion**: Light for day, rich for evening
4. **Trust Your Instincts**: Choose what makes you feel confident

Your signature scent should resonate with your personality and lifestyle.`,

Maximize your perfume's longevity and create unique combinations with these professional layering techniques.

## 1. Start with Moisturized Skin
Apply unscented lotion before perfume. Hydrated skin holds fragrance longer.

## 2. Layer Complementary Scents
Combine products from the same fragrance family for depth without clash.

## 3. Apply to Pulse Points
Wrists, neck, behind ears - these warm spots diffuse scent naturally.

## 4. Hair Perfuming
Spray on your brush before styling for a subtle, long-lasting effect.

## 5. Clothing Strategy
Light spray on fabrics extends wear time significantly.

Just as your wardrobe changes with the seasons, so should your fragrance. Here's your guide to seasonal scent selection.

## Spring: Fresh & Floral
Light florals, green notes, and citrus capture spring's renewal. Think rose, lily, and fresh-cut grass.

## Summer: Aquatic & Citrus
Bright, refreshing scents withstand heat. Ocean notes, bergamot, and light musks work beautifully.

## Autumn: Warm & Spicy
As leaves turn, embrace amber, cinnamon, and woody notes that evoke cozy evenings.

## Winter: Rich & Intense
Deep, long-lasting fragrances like oud, vanilla, and leather complement cold weather perfectly.

Rotate your collection seasonally for the perfect olfactory experience year-round.`,
